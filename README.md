# N-matrix-Calcul
N matrix calculation for 2 N matrix
----------------
##discreption
Implement the N matrix type which contains integers.
These are square matrices that can contain nonzero entries only in their first and last column, and 
in their main diagonal. Don't store the zero entries. Store only the entries that can be nonzero in a 
sequence. Implement as methods:
getting the entry located at index (i, j), adding and multiplying two N-matrices, and printing the Nmatrix (in a
square shape).
